# Detection-Of-network-attack-Using-machine-Learning-Techniques
in this project i used Python and Machine learning Algorithms like Support vector machine,Decision tree,random Forest algorithm.
Based on accuracy od datset we can detect whether is there any detection found in network or not based on machine learning algorithms.
